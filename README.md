inxi is included with this program which is released under the GNU GPL v3 licence, credits below: - 

inxi is is a fork of locsmif's largely unmaintained yet very clever, infobash script.Original infobash author and copyright holder: Copyright (C) 2005-2007  Michiel de Boer a.k.a. locsmif inxi version: Copyright (C) 2008-15 Scott Rogers & Harald Hope 
Further fixes (listed as known): Horst Tritremmel <hjt at sidux.com>
Steven Barrett (aka: damentz) - usb audio patch; swap percent used patch.  Jarett.Stevens - dmidecode -M patch for older systems with no /sys and a special thanks to the nice people at irc.oftc.net channels #linux-smokers-club and #smxi, who  all really have to be considered to be co-developers because of their non-stop enthusiasm and willingness to provide real time testing and debugging of inxi development.

Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel based Free Desktop systems to test on, we could never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid as it's turning out to be and of course, big thanks locsmif, who figured out a lot of the core methods, logic, and tricks used in inxi.
